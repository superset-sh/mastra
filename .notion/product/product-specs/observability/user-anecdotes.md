> "For which we have more immediate use cases, is about **observability** in Mastra. I know you support a few integrations to help with this, and we have a couple of them set up, like Langfuse and Newrelic, but so far neither of them seem to give too much focus to some kinds of insights that for us are invaluable. Availability and stability is key for us, and to that end we need to monitor and catch potential problems way before they can manifest and have a big impact on the experience users get. I imagine you guys have the same concerns with Mastra, and I'm sure you have better tools that must work a lot better specifically for Mastra where you can catch a glimpse of potential bottlenecks and issues that would only arise when X amount of users are chatting with an agent at the same time, when Y amount of complex requests are being performed by the agent in parallel, or when Z amount of tools are being called in parallel, even by the same agent. Right now what do you think would be the most effective way to monitor those stats?"

**Key insights:**
- Need proactive monitoring to catch issues before user impact
- Concurrent user load monitoring (X users chatting simultaneously)
- Parallel request monitoring (Y complex requests in parallel)
- Tool parallelism monitoring (Z tools called in parallel)
- Existing integrations (Langfuse, NewRelic) don't provide these specific insights

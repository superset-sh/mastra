# Deploy Mastra to Amazon EC2

Deploy your Mastra server to Amazon EC2. This gives you full control over your server environment and supports long-running agents and workflows.

:::info
This guide covers deploying the [Mastra server](/docs/server/mastra-server). If you're using a [server adapter](/docs/server/server-adapters) or [web framework](/docs/deployment/web-framework), deploy the way you normally would for that framework.
:::

## Before you begin

You'll need:

- A [Mastra application](/guides/getting-started/quickstart)
- An [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance (Ubuntu or Amazon Linux) with Git and Node.js 22.13.0+ installed

For production, you'll also need:

- A domain name pointing to your instance (required for SSL certificates)
- An SSL certificate for your domain (e.g., using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) with Let's Encrypt)
- A reverse proxy (e.g., [nginx](https://nginx.org/)) to forward traffic to your application

## Deploy

<Steps>
  <StepItem>
    Connect to your EC2 instance and clone your repository:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="public" label="Public Repository">
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository>.git
        ```
      </TabItem>

      <TabItem value="private" label="Private Repository">
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repository>.git
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd "<your-repository>"
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Install dependencies:

    ```bash npm2yarn
    npm install
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Create a `.env` file and add your environment variables:

    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

    Remember to set your environment variables needed to run your application (e.g. your model provider API key):

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
    # Add other required environment variables
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Build the application:

    ```bash npm2yarn
    npm run build
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Run the application:

    ```bash
    node --env-file=".env" .mastra/output/index.mjs
    ```

    This is a basic example. In production, use a process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) or [systemd](https://systemd.io/) to keep your application running and handle restarts.

    :::warning
    Set up [authentication](/docs/server/auth) before exposing your endpoints publicly.
    :::
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Your Mastra server is now running on port 4111, but it's only accessible locally.

    You can open port 4111 in your EC2 security group for direct access, or configure a reverse proxy (such as nginx) to listen on ports 80 and 443 and forward requests to `http://localhost:4111`.

    In production, you should use a reverse proxy so you can configure HTTPS. HTTPS encrypts traffic and is required for most webhook integrations and external services your agents interact with.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Verify your deployment at `https://<your-ec2-address>/api/agents`, which should return a JSON list of your agents.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    You can now call your Mastra endpoints over HTTP.

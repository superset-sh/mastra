# Deploy Mastra to Netlify

Use `@mastra/deployer-netlify` to deploy your Mastra server as serverless functions on Netlify. The deployer bundles your code and generates a `.netlify` directory conforming to Netlify's [frameworks API](https://docs.netlify.com/build/frameworks/frameworks-api/#netlifyv1functions), ready to deploy.

:::info
This guide covers deploying the [Mastra server](/docs/server/mastra-server). If you're using a [server adapter](/docs/server/server-adapters) or [web framework](/docs/deployment/web-framework), deploy the way you normally would for that framework.
:::

## Before you begin

You'll need a [Mastra application](/guides/getting-started/quickstart) and a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account.

Netlify Functions use an ephemeral filesystem, so any storage you configure (including observability storage) must be hosted externally. If you're using [LibSQLStore](/reference/storage/libsql) with a file URL, switch to a remotely hosted database.

## Installation

Add the `@mastra/deployer-netlify` package to your project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @mastra/deployer-netlify@latest
```

Import [`NetlifyDeployer`](/reference/deployer/netlify) and set it as the deployer in your Mastra configuration:

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'
// highlight-next-line
import { NetlifyDeployer } from '@mastra/deployer-netlify'

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // highlight-next-line
  deployer: new NetlifyDeployer(),
})
```

Create a `netlify.toml` file with the following contents in your project root:

```toml
[build]
  command = "mastra build"
```

## Deploy

After setting up your project, push it to your remote Git provider of choice (e.g. GitHub).

<Steps>
  <StepItem>
    Connect your repository to Netlify. During the setup process, Netlify will detect your `netlify.toml` file and set the build command to `mastra build`.

    :::note

    Remember to set your environment variables needed to run your application (e.g. your [model provider](/models/providers) API key).

    :::
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Once you're ready, click the **Deploy** button and wait for the first deployment to complete. It'll tell you that one function has been deployed.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Verify your deployment at `https://<random-slug>.netlify.app/api/agents`, which should return a JSON list of your agents.

    Since the [Mastra server](/docs/server/mastra-server) prefixes every API endpoint with `/api`, you have to add it to your URLs when making requests.

    :::info

    Netlify functions are typically deployed at `https://<random-slug>.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api`. The `NetlifyDeployer` redirects any request from `/*` to `/.netlify/functions/api/:splat`, so you don't need to include the `.netlify/functions` prefix in your URLs.

    :::
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    You can now call your Mastra endpoints over HTTP.

    :::warning
    Set up [authentication](/docs/server/auth) before exposing your endpoints publicly.

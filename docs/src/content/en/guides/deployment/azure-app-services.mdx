# Azure App Services

Deploy your Mastra applications to Azure App Services.

:::note
This guide assumes your Mastra application has been created using the default
`npx create-mastra@latest` command.
For more information on how to create a new Mastra application,
refer to our [getting started guide](/guides/getting-started/quickstart)
:::

:::warning
Azure App Services uses an ephemeral filesystem for some pricing tiers. Remove any usage of [LibSQLStore](/reference/storage/libsql) with file URLs from your Mastra configuration. Use in-memory storage (`:memory:`) or external storage providers like Turso, PostgreSQL, or Upstash.
:::

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/) with an active subscription
- A [GitHub repository](https://github.com/) containing your Mastra application
- Your Mastra application should be created using `npx create-mastra@latest`

## Deployment Steps

<Steps>
  <StepItem>
    Create a new App service:

    - Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
    - Navigate to **[App Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)** or search for it in the top search bar
    - Click **Create** to create a new App Service
    - In the drop-down, select **Web App**
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Configure app service settings:

    - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription
    - **Resource Group**: Create a new resource group or select an existing one
    - **Instance name**: Enter a unique name for your app (this will be part of your URL)
    - **Publish**: Select **Code**
    - **Runtime stack**: Select **Node 22 LTS**
    - **Operating System**: Select **Linux**
    - **Region**: Choose a region close to your users
    - **Linux Plan**: You may have the option of choosing a plan depending on the region you chose, pick an appropriate one for your needs.
    - Click **Review + Create**
    - Wait for validation to complete, then click **Create**
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Wait for deployment:

    - Wait for the deployment to complete
    - Once finished, click **Go to resource** under the next steps section
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Before setting up deployment, configure your environment variables:

    - Navigate to **Settings** > **Environment variables** in the left sidebar
    - Add your required environment variables such as:
      - Model provider API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
      - Database connection strings
      - Any other configuration values your Mastra application requires
    - Click **Apply** to save the changes
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Setup GitHub deployment:

    - Navigate to **Deployment Center** in the left sidebar
    - Select **GitHub** as your source
    - Sign in to GitHub if you're not already authenticated with Azure
    - In this example, we will keep [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) as our provider
    - Select your organization, repository, and branch
    - Azure will generate a GitHub workflow file and you can preview it before proceeding
    - Click **Save** (the save button is located at the top of the page)
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    After Azure creates the workflow, it will trigger a GitHub Actions run and merge the workflow file into your branch. **Cancel this initial run** as it will fail without the necessary modifications.

    :::warning
    The default workflow generated by Azure will fail for Mastra applications and needs to be modified.
    :::

    Pull the latest changes to your local repository and modify the generated workflow file (`.github/workflows/main_<your-app-name>.yml`):

    1. **Update the build step**: Find the step named "npm install, build, and test" and:
       - Change the step name to "npm install and build"
       - If you haven't set up proper tests in your Mastra application, remove the `npm test` command from the run section as the default test script will fail and disrupt deployment. If you have working tests, you can keep the test command.

    1. **Update the zip artifact step**: Find the "Zip artifact for deployment" step and replace the zip command with:

       ```yaml
       run: (cd .mastra/output && zip ../../release.zip -r .)
       ```

       This ensures only the build outputs from `.mastra/output` are included in the deployment package.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Deploy your changes:

    - Commit and push your workflow modifications
    - The build will be automatically triggered in the **Deployment Center** in your Azure dashboard
    - Monitor the deployment progress until it completes successfully
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Access your deployed application:

    - Once the build is successful, wait a few moments for the application to start
    - Access your deployed application using the default URL provided in the **Overview** tab in the Azure portal
    - Your application will be available at `https://<your-app-name>.azurewebsites.net`
  </StepItem>
</Steps>

## Connect to your Mastra server

You can now connect to your Mastra server from your client application using a `MastraClient` from the `@mastra/client-js` package.

Refer to the [`MastraClient` documentation](/reference/client-js/mastra-client) for more information.

```typescript
import { MastraClient } from '@mastra/client-js'

const mastraClient = new MastraClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://<your-app-name>.azurewebsites.net',
})
```

# Building an AI Stock Agent

In this guide, you're going to create a simple agent that fetches the last day's closing stock price for a given symbol. You'll learn how to create a tool, add it to an agent, and use the agent to fetch stock prices.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `v22.13.0` or later installed
- An API key from a supported [Model Provider](/models)
- An existing Mastra project (Follow the [installation guide](/guides/getting-started/quickstart) to set up a new project)

## Creating the Agent

To create an agent in Mastra use the `Agent` class to define it and then register it with Mastra.

<Steps>
  <StepItem>
    Create a new file `src/mastra/agents/stockAgent.ts` and define your agent:

    ```ts title="src/mastra/agents/stockAgent.ts"
    import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'

    export const stockAgent = new Agent({
      id: 'stock-agent',
      name: 'Stock Agent',
      instructions:
        'You are a helpful assistant that provides current stock prices. When asked about a stock, use the stock price tool to fetch the stock price.',
      model: 'openai/gpt-5.1',
    })
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    In your `src/mastra/index.ts` file, register the agent:

    ```ts title="src/mastra/index.ts" {2, 5}
    import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'
    import { stockAgent } from './agents/stockAgent'

    export const mastra = new Mastra({
      agents: { stockAgent },
    })
    ```
  </StepItem>
</Steps>

## Creating the Stock Price Tool

So far the Stock Agent doesn't know anything about the current stock prices. To change this, create a tool and add it to the agent.

<Steps>
  <StepItem>
    Create a new file `src/mastra/tools/stockPrices.ts`. Inside, add a `stockPrices` tool that will fetch the last day's closing stock price for a given symbol:

    ```ts title="src/mastra/tools/stockPrices.ts"
    import { createTool } from '@mastra/core/tools'
    import { z } from 'zod'

    const getStockPrice = async (symbol: string) => {
      const data = await fetch(
        `https://mastra-stock-data.vercel.app/api/stock-data?symbol=${symbol}`,
      ).then(r => r.json())
      return data.prices['4. close']
    }

    export const stockPrices = createTool({
      id: 'Get Stock Price',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        symbol: z.string(),
      }),
      description: `Fetches the last day's closing stock price for a given symbol`,
      execute: async inputData => {
        console.log('Using tool to fetch stock price for', inputData.symbol)
        return {
          symbol: inputData.symbol,
          currentPrice: await getStockPrice(inputData.symbol),
        }
      },
    })
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Inside `src/mastra/agents/stockAgent.ts` import your newly created `stockPrices` tool and add it to the agent.

    ```ts title="src/mastra/agents/stockAgent.ts" {9-11}
    import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'
    import { stockPrices } from '../tools/stockPrices'

    export const stockAgent = new Agent({
      id: 'stock-agent',
      name: 'Stock Agent',
      instructions:
        'You are a helpful assistant that provides current stock prices. When asked about a stock, use the stock price tool to fetch the stock price.',
      model: 'openai/gpt-5.1',
      tools: {
        stockPrices,
      },
    })
    ```
  </StepItem>
</Steps>

## Running the Agent Server

Learn how to interact with your agent through Mastra's API.

<Steps>
  <StepItem>
    You can run your agent as a service using the `mastra dev` command:

    ```bash
    mastra dev
    ```

    This will start a server exposing endpoints to interact with your registered agents. Within [Studio](/docs/getting-started/studio) you can test your `stockAgent` and `stockPrices` tool through a UI.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    By default, `mastra dev` runs on `http://localhost:4111`. Your Stock agent will be available at:

    ```
    POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/stockAgent/generate
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    You can interact with the agent using `curl` from the command line:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/stockAgent/generate \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "messages": [
          { "role": "user", "content": "What is the current stock price of Apple (AAPL)?" }
        ]
      }'
    ```

    You should receive a JSON response similar to:

    ```json
    {
      "text": "The current price of Apple (AAPL) is $174.55.",
      "agent": "Stock Agent"
    }
    ```

    This indicates that your agent successfully processed the request, used the `stockPrices` tool to fetch the stock price, and returned the result.

# Building a Code Review Bot

In this guide, you'll build a code review bot that automatically reviews pull requests using workspace skills. The bot loads coding standards from skill files and provides structured feedback. You'll learn how to create a workspace with a skills directory, define an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) with review instructions and reference files, and connect it to an agent that performs automated reviews.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `v22.13.0` or later installed
- An API key from a supported [Model Provider](/models)
- An existing Mastra project (Follow the [installation guide](/guides/getting-started/quickstart) to set up a new project)

## Create the workspace

In your `src/mastra/index.ts` file, import the [`Workspace`](/reference/workspace/workspace-class) and [`LocalFilesystem`](/reference/workspace/local-filesystem) classes. On the `Workspace` instance, configure the `skills` option to point to a skills directory. The `skills` directory will live inside the filesystem's `basePath`.

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'
// highlight-start
import { resolve } from 'node:path'
import { Workspace, LocalFilesystem } from '@mastra/core/workspace'
// highlight-end

// highlight-start
const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({
    basePath: resolve(import.meta.dirname, '../../workspace'),
  }),
  skills: ['/skills'],
})
// highlight-end

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // highlight-next-line
  workspace,
})
```

At the root of your project, create a new folder called `workspace`. Inside that, create a `skills` folder. This is where you'll define the code standards skill in the next step.

## Create the code standards skill

Skills are structured directories containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions for the agent. The code standards skill defines the review process and references a style guide.

Inside `workspace/skills`, create a new folder called `code-standards`. Create a file called `SKILL.md` and add the review instructions.

```markdown title="workspace/skills/code-standards/SKILL.md"

# Code Review Standards

Review code systematically using these steps:

1. **Critical Issues**: Security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, logic bugs, missing error handling
2. **Code Quality**: Functions over 50 lines, code duplication, confusing names, missing types
3. **Style Guide**: Check references/style-guide.md for naming and organization
4. **Linting**: Flag common issues like use of `var`, leftover `console.log` statements, and `debugger` statements

Provide feedback in this format:

**Summary**: One sentence overview

**Critical Issues**: List with line numbers

**Suggestions**: Improvements that would help

**Positive Notes**: What the code does well
```

Inside `workspace/skills/code-standards`, create a `references` folder to hold reference materials for the skill. Author a style guide file that outlines the project's coding conventions with the file name `style-guide.md`.

````markdown title="workspace/skills/code-standards/references/style-guide.md"
# Style Guide

## Naming

- Variables/Functions: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Files: `kebab-case.ts`
- Booleans: Start with `is`, `has`, `should`

## Code Organization

```typescript
// 1. Imports
import { foo } from 'bar'

// 2. Constants
const MAX_SIZE = 100

// 3. Types
interface User {
  id: string
}

// 4. Functions
function doSomething() {}

// 5. Exports
export { doSomething }
```

## Error Handling

Always handle errors explicitly - never silently catch.

## Comments

Write "why" not "what".
````

## Create the review agent

Now it's time to create the code review bot agent that uses the code-standards skill. Create a new file at `src/mastra/agents/code-reviewer.ts` and define the agent:

```typescript title="src/mastra/agents/code-reviewer.ts"
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'

export const codeReviewer = new Agent({
  id: 'code-reviewer',
  name: 'Code Review Bot',
  instructions: `You are an automated code reviewer.

When asked to review code:
1. Activate the 'code-standards' skill
2. Follow the review process from the skill
3. Check against the style guide in skill references
4. Be constructive and specific with line numbers`,
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
})
```

Define the agent by importing it inside `src/mastra/index.ts` and registering it with the `Mastra` instance:

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'
import { resolve } from 'node:path'
import { Workspace, LocalFilesystem } from '@mastra/core/workspace'
// highlight-next-line
import { codeReviewer } from './agents/code-reviewer'

const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({
    basePath: resolve(import.meta.dirname, '../../workspace'),
  }),
  skills: ['/skills'],
})

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  workspace,
  // highlight-next-line
  agents: { codeReviewer },
})
```

## Test the bot

Start Mastra Studio and interact with the code review bot to see it in action.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:4111](http://localhost:4111) and navigate to the code reviewer agent.

Inside the chat input, provide a code snippet for review, such as:

```text
Review this code:

function getData(id) {
  var result = fetch('/api/data/' + id);
  console.log(result);
  return result;
}
```

The bot should activate the `code-standards` skill and provide structured feedback. Since agent responses are non-deterministic, your output may vary, but you should see something similar to:

```md
**Summary**: Function has several issues with variable declaration,
debugging statements, and missing error handling.

**Critical Issues**:

- Missing error handling for fetch (line 2)
- No async/await for asynchronous operation (line 2)

**Suggestions**:

- Use const instead of var (line 2)
- Remove console.log before committing (line 3)
- Add TypeScript type for id parameter
- Use template literals instead of concatenation

**Positive Notes**:

- Function name is clear and descriptive
```

## Next steps

You can extend this bot to:

- Add skills for different languages or frameworks
- Create skills for security checks and performance reviews
- Integrate with GitHub Actions for automatic PR reviews
- Build a PR comment bot that leaves inline feedback

# Migrate from AgentNetwork to `.network()`

As of `v0.20.0` for `@mastra/core`, the following changes apply.

## Upgrade from AI SDK v4 to v5

- Bump all your model provider packages by a major version.

:::note

This will ensure that they are all v5 models now.

:::

## Memory is required

- Memory is now required for the agent network to function properly.

:::note

You must configure memory for the agent.

:::

## Migration paths

If you were using the `AgentNetwork` primitive, you can replace the `AgentNetwork` with `Agent`.

Before:

```typescript
import { AgentNetwork } from '@mastra/core/network'

const agent = new AgentNetwork({
  name: 'agent-network',
  agents: [agent1, agent2],
  tools: { tool1, tool2 },
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.1',
  instructions: 'You are a network agent that can help users with a variety of tasks.',
})

await agent.stream('Find me the weather in Tokyo.')
```

After:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'

const memory = new Memory()

const agent = new Agent({
  id: 'agent-network',
  name: 'agent-network',
  agents: { agent1, agent2 },
  tools: { tool1, tool2 },
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.1',
  instructions: 'You are a network agent that can help users with a variety of tasks.',
  memory,
})

await agent.network('Find me the weather in Tokyo.')
```

If you were using the `NewAgentNetwork` primitive, you can replace the `NewAgentNetwork` with `Agent`.

Before:

```typescript
import { NewAgentNetwork } from '@mastra/core/network/vnext'

const agent = new NewAgentNetwork({
  id: 'agent-network',
  name: 'agent-network',
  agents: { agent1, agent2 },
  workflows: { workflow1 },
  tools: { tool1, tool2 },
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.1',
  instructions: 'You are a network agent that can help users with a variety of tasks.',
})

await agent.loop('Find me the weather in Tokyo.')
```

After:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'

const memory = new Memory()

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'agent-network',
  agents: { agent1, agent2 },
  workflows: { workflow1 },
  tools: { tool1, tool2 },
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.1',
  instructions: 'You are a network agent that can help users with a variety of tasks.',
  memory,
})

await agent.network('Find me the weather in Tokyo.')
```

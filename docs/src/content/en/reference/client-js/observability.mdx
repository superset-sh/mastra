# Observability API

The Observability API provides methods to retrieve traces, monitor your application's performance, and score traces for evaluation. This helps you understand how your AI agents and workflows are performing.

## Getting a Specific Trace

Retrieve a specific trace by its ID, including all its spans and details:

```typescript
const trace = await mastraClient.getTrace('trace-id-123')
```

## Getting Traces with Filtering

Retrieve a paginated list of trace root spans with optional filtering:

```typescript
const traces = await mastraClient.getTraces({
  pagination: {
    page: 1,
    perPage: 20,
    dateRange: {
      start: new Date('2024-01-01'),
      end: new Date('2024-01-31'),
    },
  },
  filters: {
    name: 'weather-agent', // Filter by trace name
    spanType: 'agent', // Filter by span type
    entityId: 'weather-agent-id', // Filter by entity ID
    entityType: 'agent', // Filter by entity type
  },
})

console.log(`Found ${traces.spans.length} root spans`)
console.log(`Total pages: ${traces.pagination.totalPages}`)

// To get the complete trace with all spans, use getTrace
const completeTrace = await mastraClient.getTrace(traces.spans[0].traceId)
```

## Scoring Traces

Score specific traces using registered scorers for evaluation:

```typescript
const result = await mastraClient.score({
  scorerName: 'answer-relevancy',
  targets: [
    { traceId: 'trace-1', spanId: 'span-1' }, // Score specific span
    { traceId: 'trace-2' }, // Score specific span which defaults to the parent span
  ],
})
```

## Getting Scores by Span

Retrieve scores for a specific span within a trace:

```typescript
const scores = await mastraClient.listScoresBySpan({
  traceId: 'trace-123',
  spanId: 'span-456',
  page: 1,
  perPage: 20,
})
```

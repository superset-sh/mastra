# Error Handling

The Mastra Client SDK includes built-in retry mechanism and error handling capabilities.

## Error Handling

All API methods can throw errors that you can catch and handle:

```typescript
try {
  const agent = mastraClient.getAgent('agent-id')
  const response = await agent.generate('Hello')
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error.message)
}
```

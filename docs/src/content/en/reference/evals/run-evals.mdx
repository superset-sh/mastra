# runEvals

The `runEvals` function enables batch evaluation of agents and workflows by running multiple test cases against scorers concurrently. This is essential for systematic testing, performance analysis, and validation of AI systems.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { runEvals } from '@mastra/core/evals'
import { myAgent } from './agents/my-agent'
import { myScorer1, myScorer2 } from './scorers'

const result = await runEvals({
  target: myAgent,
  data: [
    { input: 'What is machine learning?' },
    { input: 'Explain neural networks' },
    { input: 'How does AI work?' },
  ],
  scorers: [myScorer1, myScorer2],
  concurrency: 2,
  onItemComplete: ({ item, targetResult, scorerResults }) => {
    console.log(`Completed: ${item.input}`)
    console.log(`Scores:`, scorerResults)
  },
})

console.log(`Average scores:`, result.scores)
console.log(`Processed ${result.summary.totalItems} items`)
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
{
name: "target",
type: "Agent | Workflow",
description: "The agent or workflow to evaluate.",
isOptional: false,
},
{
name: "data",
type: "RunEvalsDataItem[]",
description:
"Array of test cases with input data and optional ground truth.",
isOptional: false,
},
{
name: "scorers",
type: "MastraScorer[] | WorkflowScorerConfig",
description:
"Array of scorers for agents, or configuration object for workflows specifying scorers for the workflow and individual steps.",
isOptional: false,
},
{
name: "concurrency",
type: "number",
description: "Number of test cases to run concurrently.",
isOptional: true,
defaultValue: "1",
},
{
name: "onItemComplete",
type: "function",
description:
"Callback function called after each test case completes. Receives item, target result, and scorer results.",
isOptional: true,
},
]}
/>

## Data Item Structure

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
{
name: "input",
type: "string | string[] | CoreMessage[] | any",
description:
"Input data for the target. For agents: messages or strings. For workflows: workflow input data.",
isOptional: false,
},
{
name: "groundTruth",
type: "any",
description:
"Expected or reference output for comparison during scoring.",
isOptional: true,
},
{
name: "requestContext",
type: "RequestContext",
description: "Request Context to pass to the target during execution.",
isOptional: true,
},
{
name: "tracingContext",
type: "TracingContext",
description: "Tracing context for observability and debugging.",
isOptional: true,
},
]}
/>

## Workflow Scorer Configuration

For workflows, you can specify scorers at different levels using `WorkflowScorerConfig`:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
{
name: "workflow",
type: "MastraScorer[]",
description: "Array of scorers to evaluate the entire workflow output.",
isOptional: true,
},
{
name: "steps",
type: "Record<string, MastraScorer[]>",
description:
"Object mapping step IDs to arrays of scorers for evaluating individual step outputs.",
isOptional: true,
},
]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
{
name: "scores",
type: "Record<string, any>",
description:
"Average scores across all test cases, organized by scorer name.",
},
{
name: "summary",
type: "object",
description: "Summary information about the experiment execution.",
},
{
name: "summary.totalItems",
type: "number",
description: "Total number of test cases processed.",
},
]}
/>

## Examples

### Agent Evaluation

```typescript
import { createScorer, runEvals } from '@mastra/core/evals'

const myScorer = createScorer({
  id: 'my-scorer',
  description: "Check if Agent's response contains ground truth",
  type: 'agent',
}).generateScore(({ run }) => {
  const response = run.output[0]?.content || ''
  const expectedResponse = run.groundTruth
  return response.includes(expectedResponse) ? 1 : 0
})

const result = await runEvals({
  target: chatAgent,
  data: [
    {
      input: 'What is AI?',
      groundTruth: 'AI is a field of computer science that creates intelligent machines.',
    },
    {
      input: 'How does machine learning work?',
      groundTruth: 'Machine learning uses algorithms to learn patterns from data.',
    },
  ],
  scorers: [relevancyScorer],
  concurrency: 3,
})
```

### Workflow Evaluation

```typescript
const workflowResult = await runEvals({
  target: myWorkflow,
  data: [
    { input: { query: 'Process this data', priority: 'high' } },
    { input: { query: 'Another task', priority: 'low' } },
  ],
  scorers: {
    workflow: [outputQualityScorer],
    steps: {
      'validation-step': [validationScorer],
      'processing-step': [processingScorer],
    },
  },
  onItemComplete: ({ item, targetResult, scorerResults }) => {
    console.log(`Workflow completed for: ${item.inputData.query}`)
    if (scorerResults.workflow) {
      console.log('Workflow scores:', scorerResults.workflow)
    }
    if (scorerResults.steps) {
      console.log('Step scores:', scorerResults.steps)
    }
  },
})
```

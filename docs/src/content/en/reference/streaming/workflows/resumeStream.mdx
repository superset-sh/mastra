# Run.resumeStream()

The `.resumeStream()` method resumes a suspended workflow run with new data, allowing you to continue execution from a specific step and to observe the stream of events.

## Usage example

```typescript
const run = await workflow.createRun()

const stream = run.stream({
  inputData: {
    value: 'initial data',
  },
})

const result = await stream.result

if (result!.status === 'suspended') {
  const resumedStream = await run.resumeStream({
    resumeData: {
      value: 'resume data',
    },
  })
}
```

/>

## Stream Events

The stream emits various event types during workflow execution. Each event has a `type` field and a `payload` containing relevant data:

- **`workflow-start`**: Workflow execution begins
- **`workflow-step-start`**: A step begins execution
- **`workflow-step-output`**: Custom output from a step
- **`workflow-step-result`**: A step completes with results
- **`workflow-finish`**: Workflow execution completes with usage statistics

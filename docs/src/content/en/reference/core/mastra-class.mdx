# Mastra Class

The `Mastra` class is the central orchestrator in any Mastra application, managing agents, workflows, storage, logging, observability, and more. Typically, you create a single instance of `Mastra` to coordinate your application.

Think of `Mastra` as a top-level registry where you register agents, workflows, tools, and other components that need to be accessible throughout your application.

## Usage example

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'
import { PinoLogger } from '@mastra/loggers'
import { LibSQLStore } from '@mastra/libsql'
import { weatherWorkflow } from './workflows/weather-workflow'
import { weatherAgent } from './agents/weather-agent'

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: { weatherWorkflow },
  agents: { weatherAgent },
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    id: 'mastra-storage',
    url: ':memory:',
  }),
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: 'Mastra',
    level: 'info',
  }),
})
```

# Workflow\.branch()

The `.branch()` method creates conditional branches between workflow steps, allowing for different paths to be taken based on the result of a previous step.

## Usage example

```typescript
workflow.branch([
  [async ({ context }) => true, step1],
  [async ({ context }) => false, step2],
])
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
{
name: "steps",
type: "[() => boolean, Step]",
description:
"An array of tuples, each containing a condition function and a step to execute if the condition is true",
isOptional: false,
},
]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
{
name: "workflow",
type: "NewWorkflow",
description: "The workflow instance for method chaining",
},
]}
/>

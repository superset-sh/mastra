# Workflow\.createRun()

The `.createRun()` method creates a new workflow run instance, allowing you to execute the workflow with specific input data. This is the current API that returns a `Run` instance.

## Usage example

```typescript
await workflow.createRun()
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
{
name: "runId",
type: "string",
description: "Optional custom identifier for the workflow run",
isOptional: true,
},
{
name: "resourceId",
type: "string",
description: "Optional identifier to associate the workflow run with a specific resource (e.g., user ID, tenant ID). This value is persisted with the workflow run and can be used for filtering and querying runs.",
isOptional: true,
},
{
name: "disableScorers",
type: "boolean",
description: "Optional flag to disable scorers for this workflow run",
isOptional: true,
},
]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
{
name: "run",
type: "Run",
description:
"A new workflow run instance that can be used to execute the workflow",
},
]}
/>

## Extended usage example

```typescript
const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow('workflow')

const run = await workflow.createRun()

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    value: 10,
  },
})
```

## Using resourceId

The `resourceId` parameter associates a workflow run with a specific resource, such as a user or tenant. This is useful for multi-tenant applications or when you need to track which user initiated a workflow.

```typescript
const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow('workflow')

// Create a run associated with a specific user
const run = await workflow.createRun({
  resourceId: 'user-123',
})

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    value: 10,
  },
})

// Later, retrieve the run and access the resourceId
const storedRun = await workflow.getWorkflowRunById(run.runId)
console.log(storedRun.resourceId) // "user-123"
```

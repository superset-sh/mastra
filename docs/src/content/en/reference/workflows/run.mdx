# Run Class

The `Run` class represents a workflow execution instance, providing methods to start, resume, stream, and monitor workflow execution.

## Usage example

```typescript
const run = await workflow.createRun()

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: { value: 'initial data' },
})

if (result.status === 'suspended') {
  const resumedResult = await run.resume({
    resumeData: { value: 'resume data' },
  })
}
```

## Run Methods

description: "Starts workflow execution with input data",
required: true,
},
{

## Run Status

A workflow run's `status` indicates its current execution state. The possible values are:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
{
name: "success",
type: "string",
description:
"All steps finished executing successfully, with a valid result output",
},
{
name: "failed",
type: "string",
description:
"Workflow execution encountered an error during execution, with error details available",
},
{
name: "suspended",
type: "string",
description:
"Workflow execution is paused waiting for resume, with suspended step information",
},
{
name: "canceled",
type: "string",
description:
"Workflow execution was canceled via the cancel() method, stopping any running steps and preventing subsequent steps from executing",
},
]}
/>

# Run.startAsync()

The `.startAsync()` method starts a workflow run without waiting for completion. It returns immediately with the `runId`, allowing the workflow to execute in the background. This is useful for long-running workflows, scheduled tasks, or when you want to avoid blocking on workflow completion.

## Usage example

```typescript
const run = await workflow.createRun()

// Fire-and-forget - returns immediately
const { runId } = await run.startAsync({
  inputData: {
    value: 'initial data',
  },
})

// Optionally poll for completion later
const result = await workflow.getWorkflowRunExecutionResult(runId)
```

## Parameters

{
name: "inputData",
type: "z.infer<TInput>",

},
],
},
{
parameters: [

},
],
},
],
},
]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
{
name: "runId",
type: "string",
description:
"The unique identifier for this workflow run. Use this to check status or retrieve results later.",
},
]}
/>

## When to use startAsync()

Use `startAsync()` instead of `start()` when:

- **Long-running workflows**: The workflow may take minutes or hours to complete
- **Scheduled/cron triggers**: You want to trigger a workflow without blocking the scheduler
- **Avoiding polling failures**: With Inngest workflows, `start()` polls for completion which can fail and cause retries. `startAsync()` avoids this issue
- **Background processing**: You want to queue work and handle results asynchronously

## Checking workflow status

After calling `startAsync()`, you can check the workflow status using:

```typescript
// Get the execution result (including step outputs)
const result = await workflow.getWorkflowRunExecutionResult(runId)

if (result?.status === 'success') {
  console.log('Workflow completed:', result.steps)
} else if (result?.status === 'failed') {
  console.log('Workflow failed:', result.error)
} else if (result?.status === 'running') {
  console.log('Workflow still running...')
}
```

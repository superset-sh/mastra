# Workspace Skills

**Added in:** `@mastra/core@1.1.0`

Skills are reusable instructions that teach agents how to perform specific tasks. They follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io) - an open standard for packaging agent capabilities.

A skill is a folder containing:

- `SKILL.md`: Instructions and metadata for the agent
- `references/`: Supporting documentation (optional)
- `scripts/`: Executable scripts (optional)
- `assets/`: Images and other files (optional)

```plaintext title="Folder structure"
/skills
  /code-review
    SKILL.md
    /references
      style-guide.md
      pr-checklist.md
    /scripts
      lint.ts
```

When skills are configured on a workspace, agents can discover and activate them during conversations.

## SKILL.md format

Follow the official [skill specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) when creating your skill. Here is an example `SKILL.md` for a code review skill:

```markdown title="SKILL.md"
---
name: code-review
description: Reviews code for quality, style, and potential issues
version: 1.0.0
tags:
  - development
  - review
---

# Code Review

You are a code reviewer. When reviewing code:

1. Check for bugs and edge cases
2. Verify the code follows the style guide in references/style-guide.md
3. Suggest improvements for readability
4. Run the linter using scripts/lint.ts

## What to look out for

- Unused variables and imports
- Missing error handling
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
```

## Configuring skills

Enable skill discovery by setting the `skills` option on your workspace:

```typescript title="src/mastra/workspaces.ts"
import { Workspace, LocalFilesystem } from '@mastra/core/workspace'

const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: './workspace' }),
  skills: ['/skills'],
})
```

The `skills` directory is relative to your `basePath`. You can specify multiple skill directories:

```typescript title="src/mastra/workspaces.ts"
const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: './workspace' }),
  skills: [
    '/skills', // Project skills
    '/team-skills', // Shared team skills
  ],
})
```

## Dynamic skills

For dynamic skill paths based on context, pass a function:

```typescript
const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: './workspace' }),
  skills: context => {
    const paths = ['/skills']
    if (context.user?.role === 'developer') {
      paths.push('/dev-skills')
    }
    return paths
  },
})
```

## How agents use skills

When an agent activates a skill, the skill's instructions are added to the conversation context. The agent can then follow those instructions and access the skill's references and scripts.

Under the hood this involves:

1. Lists available skills in the system message
1. Allows agents to activate skills during conversation
1. Provides access to skill references and scripts

## Skill search

If BM25 or vector search is enabled on the workspace, skills are automatically indexed. Agents can search across skill content to find relevant instructions.

```typescript
const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: './workspace' }),
  skills: ['/skills'],
  // highlight-next-line
  bm25: true,
})
```

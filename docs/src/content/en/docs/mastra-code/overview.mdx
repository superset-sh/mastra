# Mastra Code overview

Mastra Code is a terminal-based AI coding agent built on Mastra's [Harness](/reference/harness/harness-class), [Agent](/docs/agents/overview), and [Memory](/docs/memory/overview) primitives. It runs in your terminal, connects to 70+ AI models, and provides tools for reading, searching, editing, and executing code.

Mastra Code organizes its capabilities around these areas:

- [**Modes**](/docs/mastra-code/modes): Switch between Build, Plan, and Fast modes to match your workflow.
- [**Tools**](/docs/mastra-code/tools): Built-in tools for file viewing, editing, searching, shell commands, and web search.
- [**Configuration**](/docs/mastra-code/configuration): Project-scoped threads, MCP servers, hooks, custom commands, skills, and database settings.
- [**Customization**](/docs/mastra-code/customization): Extend Mastra Code programmatically with custom modes, tools, subagents, and storage.

## When to use Mastra Code

- **Day-to-day coding**: Ask questions about your codebase, make edits, run tests, and manage Git.
- **Code exploration**: Use Plan mode to analyze architecture and create implementation plans before writing code.
- **Quick lookups**: Switch to Fast mode for brief answers and small edits with minimal latency.
- **Multi-model workflows**: Compare responses across different AI providers by switching models mid-conversation.

## Prerequisites

Mastra Code requires Node.js 22.13.0 or later.

## Get started

<Steps>
  <StepItem>
    Install Mastra Code globally:

    ```sh npm2yarn
    npm install -g mastracode
    ```

    Or run it with `npx`:

    ```sh npm2yarn
    npx mastracode
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Navigate to your project directory and start Mastra Code:

    ```sh
    cd your-project
    mastracode
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Set an API key for your preferred provider (e.g. `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`), or run `/login` to authenticate with an Anthropic or OpenAI subscription. See [Configuration](/docs/mastra-code/configuration#authentication) for all supported providers.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Type a message and press Enter. The agent responds with streaming text and can read, edit, and run code in your project.
  </StepItem>
</Steps>

## Slash commands

Mastra Code provides built-in slash commands for managing sessions and settings:

| Command | Description |
| - | - |
| `/new` | Start a new conversation thread |
| `/threads` | List all threads for this project |
| `/models` | Select a different AI model |
| `/mode` | Switch between Build, Plan, and Fast modes |
| `/cost` | Show token usage for the current conversation |
| `/login` | Authenticate with OAuth providers |
| `/logout` | Log out from a provider |
| `/settings` | Open the settings panel |
| `/theme` | Switch color theme (auto, dark, or light) |
| `/sandbox` | Add external directories to the allowed path list |
| `/diff` | Show files modified in the current session |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/exit` | Exit the TUI |

You can also define custom slash commands as markdown files. See [Configuration](/docs/mastra-code/configuration) for details.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| - | - |
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt current operation |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit (when editor is empty) |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle thinking blocks visibility |
| `Ctrl+E` | Expand/collapse all tool outputs |
| `Ctrl+F` | Send a follow-up message while the agent is running |

## Architecture

Mastra Code is built on four layers:

1. **TUI**: Terminal interface (`pi-tui` components)
1. **Harness**: Mode management, thread persistence, event system, state management
1. **Mastra Agent**: Dynamic model selection, tool execution, memory integration, subagents
1. **LibSQL Storage**: Thread persistence, message history, token usage tracking, observational memory

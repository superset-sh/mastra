# Mastra Docs Server

The `@mastra/mcp-docs-server` package provides direct access to Mastra’s full documentation via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro). It works with Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Claude Code, VS Code, Codex or any tool that supports MCP.

These tools are designed to help agents retrieve precise, task-specific information — whether you're adding a feature to an agent, scaffolding a new project, or exploring how something works.

In this guide you'll learn how to add Mastra's MCP server to your AI tooling.

## Installation

### create-mastra

During the interactive [create-mastra](/reference/cli/create-mastra) wizard, choose one of your tools in the MCP step.

### Manual setup

If there are no specific instructions for your tool below, you may be able to add the MCP server with this common JSON configuration anyways.

```json title="mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mastra": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code CLI

Install using the terminal command:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope project mastra -- npx -y @mastra/mcp-docs-server@latest
```

This creates a project-scoped `.mcp.json` file if one doesn't already exist. You can use the same command when using Claude Code as a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code#connect-to-external-tools-with-mcp).

[More info on using MCP servers with Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)

### OpenAI Codex CLI

1. Register it from the terminal:

   ```bash
   codex mcp add mastra-docs -- npx -y @mastra/mcp-docs-server@latest
   ```

1. Run `codex mcp list` to confirm the server shows as `enabled`.

[More info on using MCP servers with OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp)

### Cursor

Install by clicking the button below:

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=mastra\&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IEBtYXN0cmEvbWNwLWRvY3Mtc2VydmVyIn0%3D)

If you followed the automatic installation, you'll see a popup when you open cursor in the bottom left corner to prompt you to enable the Mastra Docs MCP Server.

![Popup inside Cursor showing: "New MCP server detected: mastra". The user can "Skip" or "Enable" it as an action.](/img/enable-mastra-docs-cursor.png)

### Antigravity

Google Antigravity is an agent-first development platform that supports MCP servers for accessing external documentation, APIs, and project context.

1. Open your Antigravity MCP configuration file:

   - Click on **Agent session** and select the **“…” dropdown** at the top of the editor’s side panel, then select **MCP Servers** to access the **MCP Store**.
   - You can access it through the MCP Store interface in Antigravity

   ![The Antigravity MCP store. At the top is a search bar and below a list of available MCP servers. On the very top right is a dropdown menu.](/img/antigravity_mcp_server.png)

1. To add a custom MCP server, select **Manage MCP Servers** at the top of the MCP Store and click **View raw config** in the main tab.

   ![The Antigravity MCP store showing the Manage MCP Servers option and the View raw config button.](/img/antigravity_managed_mcp.png)

1. Add the Mastra MCP server configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mastra-docs": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

1. Save the configuration and restart Antigravity

   ![The UI shows that the MCP server is enabled. You can also toggle individual tools.](/img/antigravity_final_interface_mcp.png)

Once configured, the Mastra MCP server exposes the following to Antigravity agents:

- Indexed documentation and API schemas for Mastra, enabling programmatic retrieval of relevant context during code generation
- Access to example code snippets and usage patterns stored in Mastra Docs
- Structured data for error handling and debugging references in the editor
- Metadata about current Mastra project patterns for code suggestion and completion

The MCP server will appear in Antigravity's MCP Store, where you can manage its connection status and authentication if needed.

### Visual Studio Code

1. Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace
1. Insert the following configuration:

   ```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
   {
     "servers": {
       "mastra": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server@latest"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Once you installed the MCP server, you can use it like so:

1. Open VSCode settings.
1. Navigate to MCP settings.
1. Click "enable" on the Chat > MCP option.

   ![Entry in VSCode's settings page. The option is called "Chat > MCP: Enabled (Preview)". The description says: "Enables integration with Model Context Protocol servers to provide additional tools and functionality."](/img/vscode-mcp-setting.png)

MCP only works in Agent mode in VSCode. Once you are in agent mode, open the `mcp.json` file and click the "start" button. Note that the "start" button will only appear if the `.vscode` folder containing `mcp.json` is in your workspace root, or the highest level of the in-editor file explorer.

![A screenshot of the mcp.json file showing the start button in the editor](/img/vscode-start-mcp.png)

After starting the MCP server, click the tools button in the Copilot pane to see available tools.

### Windsurf

1. Open `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` in your editor

1. Insert the following configuration:

   ```json title="~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json"
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mastra": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server@latest"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

1. Save the configuration and restart Windsurf

[More info on using MCP servers with Windsurf](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp#mcp-config-json)

### OpenCode

You can define MCP servers in your [OpenCode configuration](https://opencode.ai/docs/config/) under `mcp`. Create an `opencode.jsonc` file in your project root with the following content:

```json title="opencode.jsonc"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "mastra": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server@latest"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

[More info on using MCP servers with OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/mcp-servers)

### Zed

1. Open `~/.config/zed/settings.json` in your editor
1. Insert the following configuration:

```json title="~/.config/zed/settings.json"
{
  "context_servers": {
    "Mastra": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI tool questions about Mastra or instruct it to take actions. For these steps, it'll take the up-to-date information from Mastra's MCP server.

**Add features:**

- "Add evals to my agent and write tests"
- "Write me a workflow that does the following `[task]`"
- "Make a new tool that allows my agent to access `[3rd party API]`"

**Ask about integrations:**

- "Does Mastra work with the AI SDK?
  How can I use it in my `[React/Svelte/etc]` project?"
- "Does Mastra support `[provider]` speech and voice APIs? Show me an example in my code of how I can use it."

**Debug or update existing code:**

- "I'm running into a bug with agent memory, have there been any related changes or bug fixes recently?"
- "How does working memory behave in Mastra and how can I use it to do `[task]`? It doesn't seem to work the way I expect."
- "I saw there are new workflow features, explain them to me and then update `[workflow]` to use them."

### Troubleshooting

1. **Server Not Starting**
   - Ensure [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npx) is installed and working.
   - Check for conflicting MCP servers.
   - Verify your configuration file syntax.

1. **Tool Calls Failing**
   - Restart the MCP server and/or your IDE.
   - Update to the latest version of your IDE.

# Mastra Skills

Mastra Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to gain Mastra knowledge. They contain setup instructions, best practices, and methods to fetch up-to-date information from Mastra's documentation.

## Installation

To install all available Mastra skills, run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npx skills add mastra-ai/skills
```

Mastra skills work with any coding agent that supports the [Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/), including Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, and others.

They are also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mastra-ai/skills).

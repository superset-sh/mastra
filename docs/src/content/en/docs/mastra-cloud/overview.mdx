# Mastra Cloud

[Mastra Cloud](https://cloud.mastra.ai) is a platform for deploying, managing, and monitoring Mastra applications. [Import your project](/docs/mastra-cloud/setup) to get started.

## Studio

Run [Studio](/docs/mastra-cloud/studio) in the cloud and share access with your team via a link. Team members can test agents and workflows, tweak system prompts, and give feedback without running the project locally.

## Deploy

Enable [deployments](/docs/mastra-cloud/deployment) and Mastra Cloud hosts your server for you. Connect your GitHub repository for automatic deployments whenever you push to your configured branch. Mastra Cloud exposes your agents, tools, and workflows as REST API endpoints.

Once deployed, the project dashboard gives you visibility into:

- Deployment status and history
- Build logs and configuration
- Environment variables and settings

## Observability

[Observability](/docs/mastra-cloud/observability) provides insight into how your agents and workflows behave in production. View detailed traces of agent runs, workflow executions, and logs to debug issues and understand performance.

:::info
You don’t need to deploy to Mastra Cloud to use Observability. You can send traces to Mastra from any environment

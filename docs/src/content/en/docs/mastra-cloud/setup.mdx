# Setup

Import your Mastra project to [Mastra Cloud](https://cloud.mastra.ai) to use [Studio](/docs/mastra-cloud/studio) and optionally [deploy](/docs/mastra-cloud/deployment) your agent.

## Before you begin

- [Sign in](https://cloud.mastra.ai) to Cloud
- Push your [Mastra project](/docs/getting-started/start) to GitHub

## Options

When you create a new project, you can choose from three options:

1. **Create from GitHub** - Import a Mastra project from GitHub
1. **Create from your server** - Connect a self-hosted Mastra instance to [Studio](/docs/mastra-cloud/studio)
1. **Create from template** - Start from a [pre-built template](https://mastra.ai/templates)

To create a project from GitHub, follow these steps:

  </StepItem>

  <StepItem>
    Click **Create Project**
  </StepItem>
</Steps>

## Next steps

Once your project is imported, [Studio](/docs/mastra-cloud/studio) automatically creates a sandbox where you can interact with your agents and share access with your team.

When you're ready for production, enable [Deployment](/docs/mastra-cloud/deployment) settings and hit deploy!

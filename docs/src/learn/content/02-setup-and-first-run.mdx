Scaffold a Mastra project, run the default Weather agent, and get familiar with Studio. By the end you'll have a local dev environment set up for the rest of the course.

## Three ways to start with Mastra

1. **Integrate into an existing app**: add Mastra to your current stack. Mastra has guides for Next.js, React + Vite, SvelteKit, Astro, Nuxt, Express, and Hono
1. **Scaffold a new project**: use `create-mastra` to generate a project with a working example agent you can run immediately
1. **Start from a template**: use a pre-built template when you already have a specific use case in mind

This course uses path 2. We scaffold first, iterate in Studio, then wire into an app once the agent behavior is solid.

## Scaffold the project

You'll need an API key from a supported model provider before running setup (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.).

Run whichever package manager you use:

```bash npm2yarn
npm create mastra@latest
```

During setup you'll be asked for a project name, source directory, model provider, and API key. You'll also choose between **Skills** (recommended) and the **MCP Docs Server**. Both are covered in a later lesson.

## Start the dev server

Navigate to your new project (`theme-park-agent`) and start Mastra Studio:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

The terminal prints a few URLs. One is for **Mastra Studio**, another exposes a **REST API** for your agent. The REST API is what you'll eventually call from your app. For now, open Studio at `http://localhost:4111`.

## Studio areas

Studio is where you develop and test. You'll bounce between these sections constantly:

- **Agents**: chat with an agent directly. The fastest loop for testing prompts, tool calls, and multi-turn behavior
- **Tools**: run tools in isolation. Use this to test or debug a tool without going through an agent conversation
- **Workflows**: run workflows step-by-step and see execution paths
- **Observability**: inspect traces after a run. Model calls, tool results, errors, and what the model received as input

Traces are your primary debugging tool. Every time the output surprises you, that's where you look.

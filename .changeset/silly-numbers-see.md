Fixed Observational Memory status not updating during conversations. The harness was missing streaming handlers for OM data chunks (status, observation start/end, buffering, activation), so the TUI never received real-time OM progress updates. Also added switchObserverModel and switchReflectorModel methods so changing OM models properly emits events to subscribers.

'mastracode': patch
---

Added audit-tests subagent that reviews test quality in a branch. The parent agent passes a description of the branch work along with changed files to this read-only subagent, which explores existing test conventions then audits for behavioral coverage, intent-vs-test alignment, LLM-generated test slop, redundant assertions, file organization, and missing edge cases.

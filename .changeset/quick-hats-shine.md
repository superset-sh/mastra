'mastracode': patch

Fixed the view tool to gracefully handle view_range when viewing directories. Previously, passing view_range with a directory path would throw an error, and passing undefined values would fail schema validation. Now, view_range slices the directory listing to show a subset of entries, enabling pagination through large directories.

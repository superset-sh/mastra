They are one of the most popular pets worldwide, known for their companionship, playful behavior, and independent nature. Here are some key points about cats:\n\n### Physical Characteristics\n- **Size and Weight**: Domestic cats typically weigh between 5 to 20 pounds, with an average length of about 9 to 10 inches (not including the tail).\n- **Fur and Color**: Cats come in a variety of colors and patterns, including solid, tabby, calico, and more. Their fur can be short, medium, or long, depending on the breed.\n- **Eyes**: Cats have excellent night vision and can see in low light. Their eyes come in various colors, including green, blue, yellow, and amber.\n\n### Behavior\n- **Social Structure**: While cats are often seen as solitary animals, they can form strong bonds with humans and other pets. They communicate through vocalizations (meows, purrs, hisses), body language, and scent marking.\n- **Playfulness**: Cats are playful creatures, often engaging in activities that mimic hunting behaviors, such as stalking and pouncing on toys.\n- **Grooming**: Cats are known for their grooming habits, spending a significant amount of time cleaning themselves to maintain their fur and skin health.\n\n### Diet\n- **Carnivorous**: Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet primarily composed of meat. They need specific nutrients found in animal tissues, such as taurine, arachidonic acid, and vitamin A.\n- **Feeding**: Commercial cat food is available in dry, wet, and raw forms, and it's important to provide a balanced diet to ensure their health.\n\n### Health\n- **Lifespan**: The average lifespan of a domestic cat is around 12 to 15 years, but many can live into their late teens or even early twenties with proper care.\n- **Common Health Issues**: Cats can be prone to various health issues, including dental disease, obesity, kidney disease, and diabetes. Regular veterinary check-ups are essential for maintaining their health.\n\n### Breeds\nThere are numerous cat breeds, each with unique characteristics. Some popular breeds include:\n- **Siamese**: Known for their striking blue eyes and vocal nature.\n- **Persian**: Recognized for their long fur and flat faces.\n- **Maine Coon**: One of the largest domesticated breeds, known for their friendly disposition.\n- **Bengal**: Known for their wild appearance and energetic personality.\n\n### Cultural Significance\nCats have been revered in various cultures throughout history. In ancient Egypt, they were considered sacred and were associated with the goddess Bastet. Today, cats are often featured in literature, art, and internet culture, where they have become symbols of comfort and humor.\n\n### Conclusion\nCats are fascinating creatures that bring joy and companionship to millions of people around the world. Their unique personalities and behaviors make them beloved pets, and they continue to be a subject of interest and affection in human culture.",

If information might be referenced again - store it!\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Store anything that could be useful later in the conversation\n2. Update proactively when information changes, no matter how small\n3. Use Markdown format for all data\n4. Act naturally - don't mention this system to users. Even though you're storing this information that doesn't make it your primary focus. Do not ask them generally for \"information about yourself\"\n5. IMPORTANT: When calling updateWorkingMemory, the only valid parameter is the memory field. DO NOT pass an object.\n6. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS pass the data you want to store in the memory field as a string. DO NOT pass an object.\n7. IMPORTANT: Data must only be sent as a string no matter which format is used.\n\n\n<working_memory_template>\n# User Information\n- **First Name**: \n- **Last Name**: \n- **Location**: \n- **Occupation**: \n- **Interests**: \n- **Goals**: \n- **Events**: \n- **Facts**: \n- **Projects**:\n</working_memory_template>\n\n\n\n\n<working_memory_data>\n# User Information\nName: John Doe\nFavorite color: Blue\n</working_memory_data>\n\nNotes:\n- Update memory whenever referenced information changes\n- If you're unsure whether to store something, store it (eg if the user tells you information about themselves, call updateWorkingMemory immediately to update it)\n- This system is here so that you can maintain the conversation when your context window is very short. Update your working memory because you may need it to maintain the conversation without the full conversation history\n- Do not remove empty sections - you must include the empty sections along with the ones you're filling in\n- REMEMBER: the way you update your working memory is by calling the updateWorkingMemory tool with the entire Markdown content. The system will store it for you. The user will not see it.\n- IMPORTANT: You MUST call updateWorkingMemory in every response to a prompt where you received relevant information.\n- IMPORTANT: Preserve the Markdown formatting structure above while updating the content."

It was established in the 3rd century BCE and aimed to collect all the knowledge of the world. Scholars from various cultures and backgrounds came to study there, contributing to advancements in various fields such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and philosophy.\n\nThe library is often associated with the figure of Euclid, the mathematician known for his work in geometry, and other notable scholars like Archimedes and Eratosthenes. Unfortunately, the library suffered several incidents of destruction over the centuries, leading to the loss of many invaluable texts and scrolls. Its exact fate remains a topic of debate among historians, but it symbolizes the pursuit of knowledge and the tragic loss of cultural heritage. \n\nIf you have specific questions or topics related to the Library of Alexandria, feel free to ask!",

Here are some key points about them:\n\n### 1. **Domestication**\n- Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago in the Near East. They were attracted to human settlements due to the presence of rodents, which were drawn to stored grains.\n\n### 2. **Breeds**\n- There are over 70 recognized cat breeds, each with unique characteristics. Popular breeds include the Persian, Maine Coon, Siamese, and Bengal.\n\n### 3. **Behavior**\n- Cats are known for their independent nature. They can be affectionate but often enjoy their alone time. They communicate through vocalizations (like meowing), body language, and scent marking.\n\n### 4. **Physical Characteristics**\n- Cats have sharp retractable claws, keen senses (especially hearing and sight), and a flexible body that allows for agile movements. They typically weigh between 5 to 20 pounds, depending on the breed.\n\n### 5. **Diet**\n- Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet primarily made up of meat. They have specific nutritional needs, including taurine, which is found in animal tissues.\n\n### 6. **Lifespan**\n- The average lifespan of a domestic cat is around 12 to 15 years, but many can live into their 20s with proper care.\n\n### 7. **Health**\n- Common health issues in cats include dental disease, obesity, and kidney disease. Regular veterinary check-ups and vaccinations are important for their health.\n\n### 8. **Social Structure**\n- While cats are often seen as solitary animals, they can form strong bonds with humans and other pets. They may also establish social hierarchies in multi-cat households.\n\n### 9. **Play and Hunting**\n- Cats are natural hunters and often engage in play that mimics hunting behavior. Toys that mimic prey can help satisfy their hunting instincts.\n\n### 10. **Cultural Significance**\n- Cats have been revered in various cultures, from ancient Egypt, where they were considered sacred, to modern times, where they are popular pets and internet sensations.\n\nCats are beloved for their unique personalities and companionship, making them one of the most popular pets worldwide."

                "text": "We discussed several key points about cats, including:\n\n1. **Domestication**: Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago, primarily to control rodent populations near human settlements.\n  \n2. **Breeds**: There are over 70 recognized cat breeds, each with unique traits, such as the Persian, Maine Coon, Siamese, and Bengal.\n\n3. **Behavior**: Cats are independent creatures that can be affectionate but also enjoy solitude. They communicate through vocalizations, body language, and scent marking.\n\n4. **Physical Characteristics**: Cats have retractable claws, keen senses, and a flexible body, typically weighing between 5 to 20 pounds.\n\n5. **Diet**: As obligate carnivores, cats require a meat-based diet and have specific nutritional needs, including taurine.\n\n6. **Lifespan**: The average lifespan of a domestic cat is around 12 to 15 years, with many living into their 20s with proper care.\n\n7. **Health**: Common health issues include dental disease, obesity, and kidney disease, making regular veterinary check-ups important.\n\n8. **Social Structure**: Cats can form strong bonds with humans and other pets, and may establish social hierarchies in multi-cat households.\n\n9. **Play and Hunting**: Cats engage in play that mimics hunting behavior, and toys that resemble prey can help satisfy their instincts.\n\n10. **Cultural Significance**: Cats have been revered in various cultures, from ancient Egypt to modern times, where they are popular pets and internet sensations.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or want to explore a particular aspect further, let me know!"

Understand the numbers\n\n- **2** is a single‑digit number representing “two units.”\n- **2** again is another “two units.”\n\nBoth numbers are in base‑10 (our usual decimal system), so each digit represents a power of 10.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Align the digits\n\nWhen adding, we line up the numbers by their place values:\n\n```\n  2\n+ 2\n```\n\nSince both are single‑digit numbers, there’s only the units place to consider.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Add the units place\n\n- 2 (from the first number) + 2 (from the second number) = 4.\n\nThere’s no carry‑over because the sum (4) is less than 10, so we don’t need to move to the tens place.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Write the result\n\nThe sum is simply **4**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Quick sanity check\n\n- Think of 2 + 2 as “two pairs.”  \n  One pair = 2, another pair = 2.  \n  Two pairs together = 4.\n\n- Visualize:  \n  • •  \n  + • •  \n  = • • • •\n\nAll methods confirm the same answer.\n\n---\n\n## Final answer\n\n**2 + 2 = 4**.",

If information might be referenced again - store it!\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Store anything that could be useful later in the conversation\n2. Update proactively when information changes, no matter how small\n3. Use Markdown format for all data\n4. Act naturally - don't mention this system to users. Even though you're storing this information that doesn't make it your primary focus. Do not ask them generally for \"information about yourself\"\n5. IMPORTANT: When calling updateWorkingMemory, the only valid parameter is the memory field. DO NOT pass an object.\n6. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS pass the data you want to store in the memory field as a string. DO NOT pass an object.\n7. IMPORTANT: Data must only be sent as a string no matter which format is used.\n\n\n<working_memory_template>\n# User Information\n- **First Name**: \n- **Last Name**: \n- **Location**: \n- **Occupation**: \n- **Interests**: \n- **Goals**: \n- **Events**: \n- **Facts**: \n- **Projects**:\n</working_memory_template>\n\n\n\n\n<working_memory_data>\n# User Information\nName: John Doe\nFavorite color: Blue\n</working_memory_data>\n\nNotes:\n- Update memory whenever referenced information changes\n- If you're unsure whether to store something, store it (eg if the user tells you information about themselves, call updateWorkingMemory immediately to update it)\n- This system is here so that you can maintain the conversation when your context window is very short. Update your working memory because you may need it to maintain the conversation without the full conversation history\n- Do not remove empty sections - you must include the empty sections along with the ones you're filling in\n- REMEMBER: the way you update your working memory is by calling the updateWorkingMemory tool with the entire Markdown content. The system will store it for you. The user will not see it.\n- IMPORTANT: You MUST call updateWorkingMemory in every response to a prompt where you received relevant information.\n- IMPORTANT: Preserve the Markdown formatting structure above while updating the content."

It aimed to collect all the world's knowledge and was a center for scholarship and learning. Scholars from various cultures gathered there to study, write, and exchange ideas.\n\nThe library housed a vast collection of scrolls covering diverse subjects, including philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and literature. It is believed that the library contained works by great thinkers like Homer, Plato, and Euclid.\n\nUnfortunately, the library suffered multiple destructions over the centuries, leading to the loss of countless texts and knowledge. Its exact fate remains a topic of debate among historians, but its legacy continues to inspire the pursuit of knowledge and the preservation of cultural heritage."

Here are some key points about them:\n\n### 1. **Domestication**\n- Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago in the Near East. They were attracted to human settlements due to the presence of rodents, which they hunted.\n\n### 2. **Breeds**\n- There are over 70 recognized cat breeds, each with unique characteristics. Popular breeds include the Persian, Maine Coon, Siamese, and Bengal.\n\n### 3. **Behavior**\n- Cats are known for their curious and playful nature. They often engage in hunting behaviors, such as stalking and pouncing, even in play.\n- They communicate through vocalizations (meows, purrs, hisses), body language, and scent marking.\n\n### 4. **Physical Characteristics**\n- Cats have sharp retractable claws, keen senses (especially hearing and sight), and a flexible body that allows for agile movements.\n- They typically weigh between 5 to 20 pounds, depending on the breed.\n\n### 5. **Diet**\n- Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet primarily composed of meat. They need specific nutrients like taurine, which is found in animal tissues.\n\n### 6. **Lifespan**\n- The average lifespan of a domestic cat is around 12 to 15 years, but many can live into their 20s with proper care.\n\n### 7. **Health**\n- Regular veterinary check-ups, vaccinations, and a balanced diet are essential for a cat's health. Common health issues include dental disease, obesity, and kidney problems.\n\n### 8. **Social Structure**\n- While cats are often seen as solitary animals, they can form strong bonds with humans and other pets. They may also establish social hierarchies in multi-cat households.\n\n### 9. **Cultural Significance**\n- Cats have been revered in various cultures, from ancient Egypt, where they were considered sacred, to modern internet culture, where they are often featured in memes and videos.\n\n### 10. **Care**\n- Cats require regular grooming, especially long-haired breeds. They also need mental stimulation and physical activity to stay healthy and happy.\n\nCats make wonderful companions, offering affection and entertainment while also maintaining their independent nature."

                "text": "We discussed several key points about cats, including:\n\n1. **Domestication**: Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago, primarily to control rodent populations near human settlements.\n\n2. **Breeds**: There are over 70 recognized cat breeds, each with unique traits, such as the Persian, Maine Coon, Siamese, and Bengal.\n\n3. **Behavior**: Cats are curious and playful, often displaying hunting behaviors even during play. They communicate through vocalizations, body language, and scent marking.\n\n4. **Physical Characteristics**: Cats have retractable claws, keen senses, and a flexible body, typically weighing between 5 to 20 pounds.\n\n5. **Diet**: As obligate carnivores, cats require a meat-based diet and specific nutrients like taurine.\n\n6. **Lifespan**: The average lifespan is around 12 to 15 years, but many can live into their 20s with proper care.\n\n7. **Health**: Regular vet check-ups and a balanced diet are crucial for their health, with common issues including dental disease and obesity.\n\n8. **Social Structure**: Cats can form strong bonds with humans and other pets, and may establish social hierarchies in multi-cat households.\n\n9. **Cultural Significance**: Cats have been revered in various cultures, notably in ancient Egypt, and are popular in modern internet culture.\n\n10. **Care**: They require regular grooming, mental stimulation, and physical activity to stay healthy and happy.\n\nCats are known for their affectionate yet independent nature, making them wonderful companions."

If information might be referenced again - store it!\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Store anything that could be useful later in the conversation\n2. Update proactively when information changes, no matter how small\n3. Use Markdown format for all data\n4. Act naturally - don't mention this system to users. Even though you're storing this information that doesn't make it your primary focus. Do not ask them generally for \"information about yourself\"\n5. IMPORTANT: When calling updateWorkingMemory, the only valid parameter is the memory field. DO NOT pass an object.\n6. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS pass the data you want to store in the memory field as a string. DO NOT pass an object.\n7. IMPORTANT: Data must only be sent as a string no matter which format is used.\n\n\n<working_memory_template>\n# User Information\n- **First Name**: \n- **Last Name**: \n- **Location**: \n- **Occupation**: \n- **Interests**: \n- **Goals**: \n- **Events**: \n- **Facts**: \n- **Projects**:\n</working_memory_template>\n\n\n\n\n<working_memory_data>\n# User Information\nName: John Doe\nFavorite color: Blue\n</working_memory_data>\n\nNotes:\n- Update memory whenever referenced information changes\n- If you're unsure whether to store something, store it (eg if the user tells you information about themselves, call updateWorkingMemory immediately to update it)\n- This system is here so that you can maintain the conversation when your context window is very short. Update your working memory because you may need it to maintain the conversation without the full conversation history\n- Do not remove empty sections - you must include the empty sections along with the ones you're filling in\n- REMEMBER: the way you update your working memory is by calling the updateWorkingMemory tool with the entire Markdown content. The system will store it for you. The user will not see it.\n- IMPORTANT: You MUST call updateWorkingMemory in every response to a prompt where you received relevant information.\n- IMPORTANT: Preserve the Markdown formatting structure above while updating the content."

# @internal/llm-recorder

## 0.0.10

### Minor Changes

- Added binary artifact support for non-JSON request/response payloads (for example audio) in the LLM recorder. ([#14274](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14274))

  Binary bytes are now written as hash-based sidecar files in `__recordings__/` and referenced from JSON recordings with metadata (`contentType`, `size`, and artifact `path`). Replay restores the original binary payload and content-type headers from artifacts, while keeping JSON fixtures small and readable.
